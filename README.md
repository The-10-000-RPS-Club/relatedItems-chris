# GoOutdoor

Welcome to GoOutdoor! GoOutdoor is an open-source e-commerce platform using service oriented architecture(SOA), and this projest is specifically for the related items module in an application. This project is based on a legacy code base, which had a fully working front end with a minimum of back end. My work was focused on the back end side with database/server directories. If you're interested in my front end work, you can take a look at [Souperhost Review Section](https://github.com/souperhost-3000/service-chris)!
